## Stage 1: Audio Preprocessing

**File:** `src/workers/preprocessing.py`  
**Celery Task:** `preprocess_audio`  
**Status:** `PREPROCESSING`

### Purpose
Convert raw audio uploads to standardized 16kHz mono WAV, detect silence gaps, and split into chunks for parallel processing.

### Key Operations

1. **Download** source audio from storage (R2/S3/local)
2. **Convert** to 16kHz mono WAV via ffmpeg (streaming, no RAM spike)
3. **Normalize** loudness using EBU R128 standard (-20 LUFS target)
4. **Detect Silence** gaps using ffmpeg `silencedetect` filter (-40dB threshold, 30s minimum)
5. **Split into Chunks** with 30-second overlap at boundaries
6. **Upload** preprocessed audio + chunk manifest to storage

### Memory Efficiency
- All audio manipulation delegated to ffmpeg subprocesses
- Peak RAM: **~50 MB** regardless of recording length
- pydub removed from hot path entirely

### Output
```
preprocessed/{recording_id}/
├── audio.wav              # Full 16kHz mono WAV
└── manifest.json          # Chunk boundaries + metadata
```

### Chunk Manifest Structure
```json
{
  "recording_id": "uuid",
  "duration_ms": 32400000,
  "needs_chunking": true,
  "chunks": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "start_ms": 0,
      "end_ms": 900000,
      "audio_start_ms": 0,
      "audio_end_ms": 930000,
      "file": "chunk_000.wav"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Stage 2: Transcription (STT)

**File:** `src/workers/transcription.py`  
**Celery Task:** `dispatch_transcription` → `transcribe_chunk` (parallel)  
**Status:** `TRANSCRIBING`

### Purpose
Convert audio to text with word-level timestamps using NVIDIA Riva Parakeet STT.

### Architecture

```
dispatch_transcription
    ├─ Load manifest from storage
    ├─ Calculate chunk count from manifest["chunks"]
    │
    ├─ If single chunk (fast path):
    │   └─ transcribe_audio_task(recording_id)
    │       ├─ Download preprocessed audio.wav
    │       ├─ Apply VAD filter (optional, strips silence)
    │       ├─ Call transcribe_audio(audio_bytes)
    │       └─ Store segments + words to DB
    │
    └─ If multiple chunks (parallel path):
        └─ chord(
              [transcribe_chunk.s(recording_id, chunk_idx) for chunk_idx in range(n)],
              merge_transcription_results.s(recording_id)
           )
        │
        ├─ transcribe_chunk(recording_id, chunk_idx):
        │   ├─ Download chunk_{idx:03d}.wav from storage
        │   ├─ Apply VAD filter to chunk (if enabled)
        │   ├─ Call transcribe_audio(chunk_bytes)
        │   └─ Return (chunk_idx, segments, words, speech_segments)
        │
        └─ merge_transcription_results(results, recording_id):
            ├─ Sort results by chunk_idx
            ├─ Remap timestamps from chunk-local → global timeline
            ├─ Deduplicate overlap regions (30s boundary)
            ├─ Store all segments + words to DB
            └─ Return recording_id
```

### Chunking Strategy

**Why chunk?**
- NVIDIA Riva API has file size limits (25 MB for REST, unlimited for gRPC but timeouts apply)
- Parallel processing reduces wall-clock time for long recordings
- Memory efficiency: process 15-min chunks instead of loading 9-hour file

**Chunk Configuration:**
```python
# From settings
AUDIO_CHUNK_DURATION_MINUTES = 15    # 15-minute chunks
AUDIO_CHUNK_OVERLAP_SECONDS = 30     # 30-second overlap at boundaries

# Calculated at runtime
chunk_duration_ms = 15 * 60 * 1000   # 900,000 ms
overlap_ms = 30 * 1000               # 30,000 ms
```

**Chunk Manifest Example (9-hour recording):**
```json
{
  "recording_id": "abc-123",
  "duration_ms": 32400000,  // 9 hours
  "needs_chunking": true,
  "chunks": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "start_ms": 0,
      "end_ms": 900000,           // 15 min
      "audio_start_ms": 0,
      "audio_end_ms": 930000,     // +30s overlap
      "file": "chunk_000.wav"
    },
    {
      "index": 1,
      "start_ms": 900000,
      "end_ms": 1800000,          // 30 min
      "audio_start_ms": 870000,   // -30s overlap (from prev chunk)
      "audio_end_ms": 1830000,    // +30s overlap
      "file": "chunk_001.wav"
    }
    // ... 34 more chunks ...
  ]
}
```

### VAD (Voice Activity Detection) Integration

**Purpose:** Strip silence before STT to reduce API costs by 30-50%

**Implementation:**
```python
def _apply_vad_filter(audio_bytes: bytes) -> tuple[bytes, list[dict]]:
    """Apply Silero VAD to detect speech segments.
    
    Returns:
        - filtered_audio: Audio with silence removed
        - speech_segments: [{"start": 0.0, "end": 5.2}, ...]
    """
    # Lazy import torch/torchaudio (may not be installed)
    import torch
    from src.ai.vad import vad_filter_audio
    
    return vad_filter_audio(audio_bytes)
```

**VAD Configuration:**
```python
VAD_USE_SILERO = True
VAD_FILTER_BEFORE_STT = True
VAD_THRESHOLD = 0.5              # Probability threshold for speech
VAD_MIN_SPEECH_DURATION_MS = 100 # Ignore blips < 100ms
VAD_MIN_SILENCE_DURATION_MS = 300 # Merge gaps < 300ms
```

### Timestamp Remapping

When VAD strips silence, timestamps become chunk-local. They must be remapped to the global timeline:

```python
def _remap_timestamps(
    segments: list[dict],
    words: list[dict],
    speech_segments: list[dict],
) -> tuple[list[dict], list[dict]]:
    """Remap VAD-filtered timestamps back to original timeline.
    
    Example:
        Chunk starts at 15:00 (global)
        VAD strips first 2s of silence
        Word at 3.5s (chunk-local) → 15:03.5 (global)
    """
    # Build offset map from speech_segments
    offset_map = []
    for seg in speech_segments:
        offset_map.append({
            "chunk_start": seg["start"],
            "global_start": seg["original_start"]
        })
    
    # Remap each segment/word
    for item in segments + words:
        offset = find_offset_for_time(item["start_time"], offset_map)
        item["start_time"] += offset
        item["end_time"] += offset
    
    return segments, words
```

### Overlap Deduplication

Chunks have 30-second overlaps to prevent cutting mid-sentence. After parallel transcription, overlaps must be deduplicated:

```python
def merge_transcription_results(results, recording_id):
    """Merge chunk results, handling overlap regions.
    
    Strategy:
    1. Sort chunks by index
    2. For each adjacent pair (chunk_i, chunk_{i+1}):
       - Identify overlap region (last 30s of chunk_i, first 30s of chunk_{i+1})
       - Keep segments from chunk_i (preferred, as they have more left context)
       - Drop duplicate segments from chunk_{i+1} that fall in overlap
    3. Concatenate non-overlapping segments
    """
    all_segments = []
    all_words = []
    
    for chunk_idx, (segments, words, speech_segs) in enumerate(results):
        if chunk_idx > 0:
            # Drop segments that overlap with previous chunk
            prev_end = results[chunk_idx - 1]["end_time"]
            segments = [s for s in segments if s["start"] >= prev_end - 1.0]
            words = [w for w in words if w["start"] >= prev_end - 1.0]
        
        all_segments.extend(segments)
        all_words.extend(words)
    
    # Store to DB
    _store_transcripts_sync(recording_id, all_segments, all_words)
```

### STT Provider Abstraction

**File:** `src/ai/stt.py`

```python
def transcribe_audio(audio_bytes: bytes) -> dict:
    """Transcribe audio using configured provider.
    
    Returns:
        {
            "segments": [
                {"start": 0.0, "end": 5.2, "text": "Hello welcome", "confidence": 0.95}
            ],
            "words": [
                {"start": 0.0, "end": 0.5, "word": "Hello", "confidence": 0.98},
                {"start": 0.5, "end": 1.2, "word": "welcome", "confidence": 0.92}
            ]
        }
    """
    provider = settings.stt_provider  # "nvidia_riva" | "groq_whisper"
    
    if provider == "nvidia_riva":
        return _transcribe_nvidia_riva(audio_bytes)
    elif provider == "groq_whisper":
        return _transcribe_groq_whisper(audio_bytes)
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown STT provider: {provider}")
```

**NVIDIA Riva (gRPC):**
- Model: Parakeet 1.1B (multilingual: en, hi, ar)
- Protocol: gRPC (lower latency than REST)
- Streaming: Supports real-time streaming for live audio
- Returns: Word-level timestamps + confidence scores

**Groq Whisper (fallback, currently disabled):**
- Model: Whisper Large v3
- API: REST via Groq (ultra-fast inference)
- Limitation: 25 MB file size limit (requires chunking)

## Stage 3: Speaker Diarization

**File:** `src/workers/diarization.py`  
**Celery Task:** `dispatch_diarization` → `diarize_chunk` (parallel)  
**Status:** `DIARIZING`

### Purpose
Identify "who spoke when" by assigning speaker labels (Speaker_A, Speaker_B, etc.) to transcript segments.

### Architecture

```
dispatch_diarization
    ├─ Load manifest from storage
    ├─ If single chunk:
    │   └─ diarize_audio(recording_id)
    │       ├─ Download preprocessed audio.wav

    │       │   ├─ Try pyannote.audio (primary)
    │       │   └─ Fallback to NVIDIA NIM (if pyannote fails/disabled)
    │       ├─ Load transcript segments from DB

        │   └─ Return (chunk_idx, speaker_segments)
        │
        └─ merge_diarization_results(results, recording_id):
            ├─ Collect all speaker segments from chunks
            ├─ Run cross-chunk speaker reconciliation
            │   ├─ Analyze overlap regions (30s boundaries)
            │   ├─ Match speakers across chunks via cosine similarity
            │   └─ Build global speaker mapping
            ├─ Load transcript segments from DB
            ├─ Apply global speaker mapping
            ├─ Update transcript_segments.speaker_label
            └─ Update word_transcripts.speaker_label
```

### Diarization Engine Details

**Primary: pyannote.audio 3.x**

```python
def diarize_with_pyannote(audio_bytes: bytes) -> list[dict]:
    """Diarize using pyannote.audio 3.x (segmentation-based).
    
    Model: pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1

    Returns:
        [
            {"start": 0.0, "end": 5.2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00"},
            {"start": 5.5, "end": 12.3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01"},
            ...
        ]
    """
    from pyannote.audio import Pipeline
    import torchaudio
    import io
    
    # Load pipeline (cached after first load)
    pipeline = Pipeline.from_pretrained(
        "pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1",
        use_auth_token=settings.hugging_face_token
    )
    
    # Load audio
    waveform, sample_rate = torchaudio.load(io.BytesIO(audio_bytes))
    
    # Run diarization
    diarization = pipeline({"waveform": waveform, "sample_rate": sample_rate})
    
    # Convert to segments
    speaker_segments = []
    for turn, _, speaker in diarization.itertracks(yield_label=True):
        speaker_segments.append({
            "start": turn.start,
            "end": turn.end,
            "speaker": speaker
        })
    
    return speaker_segments
```

**Advantages:**
- Superior accuracy for multilingual retail (Hindi/English/Arabic code-switching)
- Better handling of overlapping speech
- Improved robustness with background noise
- Handles accent diversity across Middle East and South Asia

**Fallback: NVIDIA NIM Diarization API**

```python
def diarize_with_nvidia(audio_bytes: bytes) -> list[dict]:
    """Diarize using NVIDIA NIM API (fallback).
    
    Lower accuracy but no external dependency (no HF token needed).
    """
    from src.ai.nvidia_client import nvidia_client
    
    # Upload audio to NVIDIA API
    # Returns diarization result
    return nvidia_client.diarize(audio_bytes)
```

### Cross-Chunk Speaker Reconciliation

**Problem:** Chunks are processed independently, so:
- Chunk 0: Speaker_A = Salesperson, Speaker_B = Customer
- Chunk 1: Speaker_A = Customer, Speaker_B = Salesperson (labels swapped!)

**Solution:** Use 30-second overlap regions to match speakers across chunks.

```python
def reconcile_cross_chunk_speakers(chunk_results: list[dict]) -> dict[str, str]:
    """Build global speaker mapping from chunk-local labels.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. For each adjacent chunk pair (chunk_i, chunk_{i+1}):
       a. Extract speaker segments from overlap region
          - Last 30s of chunk_i
          - First 30s of chunk_{i+1}
       
       b. For each speaker in chunk_i:
          - Extract audio features (MFCC embeddings) from overlap
          - Compare to each speaker in chunk_{i+1}
          - Calculate cosine similarity
          - Match if similarity > 0.85
       
       c. Build mapping: {"chunk_1_SPEAKER_00": "global_SPEAKER_A", ...}
    
    2. Apply transitive closure:
       - If chunk_1_SPEAKER_00 → global_A
       - And chunk_2_SPEAKER_01 → chunk_1_SPEAKER_00
       - Then chunk_2_SPEAKER_01 → global_A
    
    3. Return global mapping for all chunks
    
    Returns:

### Speaker Label Assignment

## Stage 4: Conversation Turn Builder

**File:** `src/workers/turn_builder.py`  
**AI Module:** `src/ai/conversation_builder.py`  
**Celery Task:** `build_conversation_turns_task`  
**Status:** `BUILDING_TURNS`

### Purpose
Merge word-level transcripts into speaker turns based on continuity and gap detection.

### Algorithm

```python
# Turn boundary rules:
# 1. Speaker change → new turn
# 2. Gap > 1.0s → new turn (even if same speaker)
# 3. Same speaker + gap < 1.0s → same turn
```

### Key Operations

1. Load `word_transcripts` ordered by `start_time`
2. Group consecutive words by speaker label
3. Split on gaps > 1.0s
4. Aggregate into turns with word counts

### Output Table
```sql
conversation_turns:
  - recording_id, speaker_label, start_time, end_time, text, word_count
```

### Example
```
Words: [Hello(0.0-0.5), welcome(0.5-1.0), to(1.0-1.2), our(1.2-1.4), store(1.4-1.8)]
Turn:  {speaker: "Speaker_A", start: 0.0, end: 1.8, text: "Hello welcome to our store", word_count: 5}
```

## Stage 5: Speaker Role Classification

**File:** `src/workers/role_classification.py`  
**AI Module:** `src/ai/role_classifier.py`  
**Celery Task:** `classify_speaker_roles_task`  
**Status:** `CLASSIFYING_ROLES`

### Purpose
Identify which speaker is the **Salesperson** vs **Customer** using hybrid LLM + heuristic approach.

### Classification Strategy

```

          │   │ • Word count bias  │
          │   │ • Customer signals │
          │   │   (negative score) │
          │   └────────────────────┘
          │
          ▼
   Final Role Assignment
```

### Heuristic Scoring System

| Signal | Score | Priority |
|--------|-------|----------|
| First retail greeting ("Welcome", "هلا", "नमस्ते") | +5.0 | Highest |
| First service phrase ("How can I help") | +3.5 | High |
| First turn speaker | +1.5 | Medium |
| Highest word count | +1.0 | Medium |
| Service phrase mentions | +1.5 each (max 4.0) | Medium |
| Price/product mentions | +2.0 / +1.5 | Medium |
| Customer signals (objections, hesitation) | -1.0 each (max -3.0) | Negative |

### Key Features

- **Arabic Diacritic Stripping:** Removes Tashkeel before regex matching
- **Context Window Sampling:** First 20 turns (greetings) + last 5 turns (avoid LLM overflow)
- **Multilingual Patterns:** Arabic, Hindi, Urdu, English code-switching
- **Greeting Split:** Retail greetings (+5.0) vs general greetings (+1.0)

### Output
- Updates `speaker_role` in database (Salesperson/Customer/Unknown)
- Stored in `conversation_turns` table

## Stage 6: Conversation Segmentation

**File:** `src/workers/segmentation.py`  
**AI Module:** `src/ai/segmenter.py`  
**Celery Task:** `segment_conversations`  
**Status:** `SEGMENTING`

### Purpose
Split continuous recording into discrete customer conversations using silence gaps and linguistic cues.

### Segmentation Algorithm

```python
# Conversation boundary rules:
# 1. Silence gap > 60s → definite boundary
# 2. Silence gap > 20s + farewell detected → likely boundary
# 3. Silence gap > 20s + greeting in next segment → new conversation
# 4. Gap > 20s + direct question → potential new conversation
```

### Multilingual Pattern Detection

**Greetings:** English, Arabic (MSA + Gulf), Hindi, Urdu, transliterated  
**Farewells:** "Goodbye", "مع السلامة", "अलविदा", "خدا حافظ"  
**Direct Questions:** "How much?", "بكم", "कितना", "अपने पास"

### Validation Rules
- Minimum conversation duration: **10 seconds**
- Minimum segments per conversation: **2**
- Filters out noise/empty segments

### Output Table
```sql
conversations:
  - id, recording_id, start_time, end_time, duration, metadata
```

## Stage 6.5: Audio Stitching

**File:** `src/workers/audio_stitcher.py`  
**Celery Task:** `stitch_conversation_audio`  
**Status:** `STITCHING_AUDIO`

### Purpose
Extract per-conversation audio files for playback in the dashboard.

### Why Stitching?

After segmentation identifies conversation boundaries, we need standalone audio files for:
- Dashboard playback of individual conversations
- Sharing specific conversations with brands/salespeople
- Avoiding on-the-fly ffmpeg cuts at API request time (latency)

### Process

    2. Download preprocessed audio.wav (16kHz mono, full recording)
    3. For each conversation:
       a. Calculate start/end times in milliseconds
       b. Slice audio using ffmpeg (efficient, no pydub loading)
       c. Export as WAV
       d. Upload to storage: conversations/{conv_id}/audio.wav
       e. Update conversation.audio_url in DB

```

### ffmpeg Extraction

**Why ffmpeg instead of pydub?**
- Memory efficiency: pydub loads entire WAV into RAM (~500MB for 9-hour file)
- Speed: ffmpeg can seek directly to start time without decoding full file
- Streaming: ffmpeg outputs directly to disk, no intermediate Python objects

```python
def _extract_audio_segment(
    input_path: str,
    output_path: str,
    start_ms: int,
    duration_ms: int,
):
    """Extract audio segment using ffmpeg.
    
    Command:
        ffmpeg -i input.wav -ss {start}s -t {duration}s -ar 16000 -ac 1 output.wav
    
    Parameters:
        -ss: Seek to start time (seconds)
        -t: Extract duration (seconds)
        -ar 16000: Maintain 16kHz sample rate
        -ac 1: Maintain mono channel
    """
    start_sec = start_ms / 1000.0
    duration_sec = duration_ms / 1000.0
    
    cmd = [
        "ffmpeg",
        "-y",                  # Overwrite output
        "-i", input_path,      # Input file
        "-ss", str(start_sec), # Start time
        "-t", str(duration_sec), # Duration
        "-ar", "16000",        # Sample rate
        "-ac", "1",            # Mono
        "-c:a", "pcm_s16le",   # PCM 16-bit
        output_path
    ]
    
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=300)
    
    if result.returncode != 0:
        raise RuntimeError(f"ffmpeg failed: {result.stderr}")
    
    logger.info("Extracted %.1fs segment from %s", duration_sec, input_path)
```

### Fallback: Original File Conversion

If preprocessed WAV was cleaned up (e.g., storage optimization), fall back to original:

```python
def _download_and_convert_original(file_url: str, output_path: str):
    """Download original audio and convert to 16kHz mono WAV.
    
    Used as fallback when preprocessed WAV is unavailable.
    """
    # Download from storage
    storage = get_storage()
    parsed = urlparse(file_url)
    file_key = parsed.path.lstrip("/")
    audio_data = storage.download_sync(file_key)
    
    # Save to temp file
    input_path = output_path.replace(".wav", ".original")
    with open(input_path, "wb") as f:
        f.write(audio_data)
    
    # Convert using ffmpeg
    cmd = [
        "ffmpeg",
        "-y",
        "-i", input_path,
        "-ar", "16000",
        "-ac", "1",
        "-c:a", "pcm_s16le",
        output_path
    ]
    
    subprocess.run(cmd, check=True, timeout=3600)
    
    # Cleanup original
    os.remove(input_path)
```

### Database Update

```python
def _update_conversation_audio_url_sync(conversation_id: str, audio_url: str):
    """Update conversation.audio_url in database."""
    with _SessionLocal() as session:
        session.query(Conversation).filter(
            Conversation.id == uuid.UUID(conversation_id)
        ).update({"audio_url": audio_url})
        session.commit()
```

### Storage Layout

```
storage/
└── conversations/
    ├── {conv_id_1}/
    │   └── audio.wav          # 2-minute conversation (~2MB)
    ├── {conv_id_2}/
    │   └── audio.wav          # 5-minute conversation (~5MB)
    └── {conv_id_3}/
        └── audio.wav          # 1-minute conversation (~1MB)
```

### Performance

| Conversation Length | Extraction Time | File Size |
|---------------------|----------------|-----------|
| 30 seconds | ~0.5s | ~0.5 MB |
| 2 minutes | ~1s | ~2 MB |
| 5 minutes | ~2s | ~5 MB |
| 15 minutes | ~5s | ~15 MB |

            "category": {"type": "string", "enum": ["Price", "Features", "Timing", "Trust", "Competitor", "Other"]},
            "issue": "The specific customer concern or objection",
            "response": "How the salesperson addressed or responded to this objection"
        }
    },
    "competitors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Competitor brands mentioned. If none, return []"},
    "closing_attempt": true,
    "outcome": {"type": "string", "enum": ["SALE_MADE", "LOST", "FOLLOW_UP_NEEDED"]},
    "loss_reason": "If outcome is LOST, a concise explanation of why the sale was lost based on the conversation. null if outcome is not LOST",
    "confidence": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 100},
    "summary": "One paragraph summary of the conversation",
    "coaching_notes": "Specific coaching feedback for the salesperson based on their performance. Reference actual conversation moments and suggest SOP-compliant alternatives where applicable."
}

Rules:
- "outcome" must be exactly one of: SALE_MADE, LOST, FOLLOW_UP_NEEDED
- "confidence" is your confidence as an integer from 0 to 100
- "products" should list specific products discussed or requested
- "objections" must be an array of objects with category, issue, and response. If no objections, use empty array []
- "category" must be one of: Price, Features, Timing, Trust, Competitor, Other
- "competitors" should list competitor brands mentioned
- "closing_attempt" is true if the salesperson attempted to close the sale
- "loss_reason" should only be filled when outcome is LOST, otherwise null
- "customer_expectation" captures what the customer is looking for or expects from the purchase
- "coaching_notes" should be constructive and specific, referencing actual conversation moments and suggesting best-practice SOP responses
- If the conversation is too short or unclear, set confidence below 85
- If there are no products, competitors, or objections, you MUST return an empty array [], never null
- Respond ONLY with valid JSON, no additional text"""
```

### Transcript Formatting

**File:** `src/ai/utils.py`

```python
def format_transcript(segments: list[dict]) -> str:
    """Format conversation segments into readable transcript for LLM.
    
    Input:
        [
            {"start": 0.0, "end": 5.2, "text": "Hello welcome", "speaker": "Speaker_A"},
            {"start": 5.5, "end": 12.3, "text": "Hi I'm looking for a phone", "speaker": "Speaker_B"}
        ]
    
    Output:
        [Speaker_A] (0.0s - 5.2s): Hello welcome
        [Speaker_B] (5.5s - 12.3s): Hi I'm looking for a phone
    """
    lines = []
    for seg in segments:
        speaker = seg.get("speaker", "Unknown")
        start = seg["start"]
        end = seg["end"]
        text = seg["text"]
        
        lines.append(f"[{speaker}] ({start:.1f}s - {end:.1f}s): {text}")
    
    return "\n".join(lines)
```

### LLM API Call with Retry Logic

```python
def analyze_conversation(
    conversation_segments: list[dict[str, Any]],
    max_retries: int = 2,
) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
    """Analyze a single conversation using Llama 3.3 70B.
    
    Retry strategy:

    - Attempt 2: temperature=0.5 (even more creative)
    """
    if not conversation_segments:
        logger.warning("Empty conversation segments — skipping analysis")
        return None
    
    # Format conversation for the prompt
    transcript_text = format_transcript(conversation_segments)
    
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"Analyze this retail conversation:\n\n{transcript_text}"},
    ]
    
    for attempt in range(max_retries + 1):
        try:
            # Slightly increase temperature on retries to escape local minima
            temp = 0.1 if attempt == 0 else 0.3
            
            response_text = nvidia_client.chat_completion(

                max_tokens=2048,
                response_format={"type": "json_object"},
            )
            
            analysis = _parse_analysis_response(response_text)
            if analysis is None:
                logger.warning("Failed to parse analysis response (attempt %d)", attempt + 1)
                continue
            
            return analysis
            
        except NVIDIAAPIError as e:

                return None
            continue
    
    return None
```

### Robust JSON Parsing

**Critical:** LLMs sometimes return JSON wrapped in markdown code blocks or with extra text.

```python
def _parse_analysis_response(response_text: str) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
    """Parse and validate LLM analysis response.
    
    Handles:

        cleaned = response_text.strip()
        if cleaned.startswith("```"):
            # Remove markdown code fence
            lines = cleaned.split("\n")
            if lines[0].startswith("```"):
                lines = lines[1:]  # Remove opening fence
            if lines and lines[-1].strip() == "```":
                lines = lines[:-1]  # Remove closing fence
            cleaned = "\n".join(lines)
        
        # Find JSON object (handle cases where LLM adds extra text)
        start_idx = cleaned.find("{")
        end_idx = cleaned.rfind("}") + 1
        if start_idx == -1 or end_idx == 0:
            logger.warning("No JSON object found in response (first 200 chars): %s", response_text[:200])
            return None
        
        json_str = cleaned[start_idx:end_idx]
        data = json.loads(json_str)
        
        # Validate required fields
        required_fields = ["intent", "outcome", "confidence", "summary"]
        for field in required_fields:
            if field not in data:
                logger.warning("Missing required field in analysis: %s", field)
                return None

            return None
        
        return data
        
    except (json.JSONDecodeError, KeyError, TypeError) as e:

## Stage 8: Performance Scoring

**File:** `src/workers/scoring.py`  
**AI Module:** `src/ai/scorer.py`  
**Celery Task:** `score_salesperson`  
**Status:** `SCORING`

### Purpose
Score salesperson performance across 5 dimensions for coaching insights.

### Scoring Dimensions

| Dimension | Criteria | Score Range |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Greeting** | Warmth, professionalism, speed | 0-100 |
| **Discovery** | Quality of needs-finding questions | 0-100 |
| **Product Knowledge** | Accuracy and depth of product info | 0-100 |
| **Objection Handling** | Effectiveness at resolving concerns | 0-100 |
| **Closing** | Number and quality of closing attempts | 0-100 |

### Scoring Rubric Example (Greeting)

- **90-100:** Warm, professional, immediate acknowledgment
- **70-89:** Friendly but could be more personalized
- **50-69:** Basic greeting, lacks warmth
- **0-49:** No greeting or rude/abrupt start

### Output Tables
```sql
salesperson_scores:
  - salesperson_id, conversation_id, greeting_score,
    discovery_score, product_knowledge_score,
    objection_handling_score, closing_score

daily_metrics:
  - date, store_id, salesperson_id, avg_score,
    total_conversations, total_sales, conversion_rate
```

---

## Pipeline Orchestration

**File:** `src/workers/pipeline.py`

### Celery Chain

```python
processing_chain = chain(
    preprocess_audio.s(recording_id),              # Stage 1
    dispatch_transcription.s(),                     # Stage 2 (parallel chord)
    dispatch_diarization.s(),                       # Stage 3 (parallel chord)
    build_conversation_turns_task.s(),             # Stage 4
    classify_speaker_roles_task.s(),               # Stage 5
    segment_conversations.s(),                     # Stage 6
    stitch_conversation_audio.s(),                 # Stage 6.5
    analyze_conversations.s(),                     # Stage 7
    score_salesperson.s(),                         # Stage 8
)
return processing_chain.apply_async()
```

### Parallel Processing

**Transcription & Diarization** use Celery chords for parallel chunk processing:

```python
# dispatch_transcription example
chunks = load_manifest(recording_id)["chunks"]
if len(chunks) > 1:
    chord_result = chord(
        [transcribe_chunk.s(recording_id, i) for i in range(len(chunks))],
        merge_transcription_results.s(recording_id)
    )
    return self.replace(chord_result)
else:
    return transcribe_audio_task.delay(recording_id)
```

### Status Transitions

```
UPLOADED → PREPROCESSING → TRANSCRIBING → DIARIZING → 
BUILDING_TURNS → CLASSIFYING_ROLES → SEGMENTING → 
STITCHING_AUDIO → ANALYZING → SCORING → COMPLETED
                                          ↓
                                       FAILED (on error)
```

### NVIDIA Client

**File:** `src/ai/nvidia_client.py`

Centralized client for NVIDIA NIM API with:
- Chat completion (Llama 3.3 70B)
- STT (Riva Parakeet via gRPC)
- Diarization (fallback)
- Error handling + retry logic

### Utility Functions

**`format_transcript(segments)`**  
Formats conversation segments into readable transcript for LLM prompts:

```
[Speaker_A] (0.0s - 5.2s): Hello, welcome to our store!
[Speaker_B] (5.5s - 12.3s): Hi, I'm looking for a phone.
```

## Error Handling & Retry Logic

### Celery Task Configuration

```python
@celery_app.task(bind=True, max_retries=3, default_retry_delay=120)
def task_name(self, recording_id: str):
    try:
        # Task logic
        pass
    except Exception as exc:
        if self.request.retries >= self.max_retries:
            fail_and_halt(recording_id, "Error message")
            raise Ignore()
        raise self.retry(exc=exc)
```

### Pipeline Halt on Critical Failure

If a task fails after max retries:
1. Recording status set to `FAILED`
2. Error message logged
3. Pipeline chain stops (no further tasks execute)
4. `Ignore()` exception prevents retry loop

### LLM-Specific Error Handling

- **Empty Response:** Retry with increased temperature
- **JSON Parse Error:** Retry up to 2 times
- **API Error:** Fall back to heuristic (role classifier) or skip (analyzer/scorer)

---

## Configuration

**File:** `src/config.py`

### Key Settings

```python
# Audio Processing
TARGET_SAMPLE_RATE = 16000
SILENCE_THRESHOLD_DB = -40
SILENCE_GAP_MS = 30000
AUDIO_CHUNK_DURATION_MINUTES = 15
AUDIO_CHUNK_OVERLAY_SECONDS = 30

# VAD
VAD_USE_SILERO = True
VAD_FILTER_BEFORE_STT = True

# LLM
NVIDIA_API_KEY = "nvapi-..."
LLM_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.7
MIN_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 50

# Diarization
PYANNOTE_ENABLED = True
HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN = "hf_..."
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Memory Usage

| Stage | Peak RAM | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Preprocessing | ~50 MB | ffmpeg streaming, no RAM spike |
| STT (per chunk) | ~200 MB | AudioSegment in memory |
| Diarization (per chunk) | ~1.5 GB | pyannote.audio model |
| Turn Builder | ~100 MB | DB query results |
| Role Classification | ~50 MB | LLM API call |
| Segmentation | ~50 MB | In-memory processing |
| Audio Stitching | ~500 MB | pydub AudioSegment |
| LLM Analysis | ~50 MB | API call per conversation |
| Scoring | ~50 MB | API call per conversation |

### Processing Time Estimates

| Recording Length | Preprocessing | STT (parallel) | Diarization | Total Pipeline |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| 5 minutes | ~30s | ~15s | ~45s | ~3-5 min |
| 1 hour | ~2 min | ~5 min (4 chunks) | ~8 min | ~15-20 min |
| 9 hours | ~10 min | ~45 min (36 chunks) | ~60 min | ~2-3 hours |

---

## Monitoring & Observability

### Celery Flower

Real-time task monitoring at `http://localhost:5555`:
- Task status (PENDING, STARTED, SUCCESS, FAILED)
- Execution time per task
- Worker utilization

### Logging

Each task logs with recording ID prefix:
```
[recording_id] Starting audio preprocessing
[recording_id] Manifest: 12 chunks from 8 silence gaps
[recording_id] Transcription successful: 245 segments
```

### Status Tracking

Recording status updates at each stage, queryable via API:
```python
GET /api/v1/recordings/{id}
→ { "status": "ANALYZING", "progress": 78 }
```

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Streaming:** Process audio as it's recorded (WebSocket)
2. **Voiceprint Enrollment:** Persistent speaker identification across recordings
3. **Cross-Conversation Tracking:** Link customers across multiple visits
4. **Sentiment Analysis:** Emotional tone tracking per conversation
5. **Custom LLM Fine-tuning:** Domain-specific model for retail sales
6. **GPU Acceleration:** pyannote.audio on GPU for 5x speedup
7. **Batch Processing:** Process multiple recordings in parallel

---

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **ffmpeg over pydub** | Memory efficiency for 9+ hour recordings |
| **Celery chords** | Parallel chunk processing for STT/diarization |
| **pyannote.audio primary** | Superior multilingual accuracy |
| **LLM + heuristic hybrid** | Reliability when LLM unavailable |
| **Context window sampling** | Prevent LLM overflow on long conversations |
| **Arabic diacritic stripping** | Regex robustness with ASR output |
| **Word count over turn count** | Better salesperson signal (customers take more short turns) |
